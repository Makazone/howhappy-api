Review @PRODUCT_SPEC.md and create ARCHITECTURE.md
  which will outline the high level architecture, data
  model design and api design for a TypeScript backend
  app that implements the said spec. Keep in mind that
  this spec is not exhaustive. You are allowed to make
  resonable assumptions but keep it simple and easy
  without introducing significant features.
